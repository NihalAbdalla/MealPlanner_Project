# MealPlanner_Project

This webpage main focus is to utilize APIs to create a unique website. 
Basic HTML, CSS, and Boostrap were used to style this webpage.
Javascript added functionality to the website which allows our users to put an ingredient in our search bar, which is fed into TheMealDB suppling the user with recipe choices. From here the user can select the recipe that interests them the most, again putting that selection into TheMealDB generating a list of ingredients. The list of ingredients are looped through and fed into Edamam which grabs our nutritional data from each ingredient and sums the total calories, carbs, fat, and proteins so that they can be displayed for the user's benefit. 

This functionality was achieved with vanilla Javascript and API fetch/post calls.
